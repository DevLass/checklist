### *Today, i used to a website with complex backgrounds*
### *https://www.gradientmagic.com/*
### *Recommend to understand the breadth of css options*
### *Besides, of course, finding magnificent backgrounds*
### *They differ greatly from the traditional linear gradient*

#### ***********************************************************************************************************************
###   *Here, i'll show you something i use in almost every project*
###   *But i never commented around here*
###   *My github and linkedin icons*
###   *They are from a library called feather icons that posts much more than the two mentioned*
###   *Here's the link:*
###   *https://feathericons.com/*
###
###   *To use it without downloading anything, insert this script in your body*
###
###   *- - <script src="https://unpkg.com/feather-icons"></script>*
###     *- - - - <script>*
###        *- - - - - feather.replace()*
###    *- - - - </script>*
###
###    *Then just enter:*
###    *- <i data-feather="linkedin"< </i <*
###    *With the desired icon name*
####   *The > are exchanged for < so that read.me doesn't interpret it as commands*
